# Weather App Csharp Donet (Console Application) 

This is a simple console-based weather application built in C# using .NET. The application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays essential weather details like temperature, humidity, and conditions for a given city.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to consume external APIs in a .NET console application, handle JSON responses, and work with asynchronous programming in C#.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 2 How to deploy to Azure

### Steps to deploy to Azure App Service
1. Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed ([Download here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)).
2. Login to Azure:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
3. Create an Azure Web App:
   ```bash
   az webapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --plan MyPlan --name WeatherAppCSharp --runtime "DOTNETCORE:7.0"
   ```
4. Publish the app:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
   az webapp deploy --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name WeatherAppCSharp --src-path ./publish
   ```
5. Visit your deployed application via the Azure-provided URL.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3 How I created the app

New console app:
```
dotnet new console -n WeatherApp
```

Added `HttpClient` to call the OpenWeatherMap API, parsed JSON responses using `System.Text.Json`, and formatted the output to display weather details in the console.
